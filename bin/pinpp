=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ pinpp mytalk.pinpp > mytalk.pin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a pre-processor for pinpoint, a presentation tool that uses text-based files as input.
It will read a file, process any special directives (see below) inside it, and write the output
on stdout.

=head2 SYNTAX

=head3 @include 

    @include <autonomous-vehicles.pin>

One of the main uses for C<pinpp> is to allow various topic arcs to be included in a larger
one. By default, the C<topics/> directory will be searched for these files, but this can be
modified by passing an argument to the C<-I> switch.

=head2 EXAMPLES

https://github.com/pjf/future-is-awesome is an example talk using pinpoint and pinpp.
