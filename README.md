# pinpp

The Pinpoint Pre-processor

## What is this?

Pinpoint is an awesome system for writing slides, but it can get tricky to work with if you're writing really *big* decks of slides. Just like you'd break up your code into separate files by topic, the `pinpp` command lets you break your slides up into smaller, more easy-to-manage chunks.

## Have ye an example?

Sure! Go check out the slides for [The Future Is Awesome](https://github.com/pjf/future-is-awesome) for an example presentation using this technology.
